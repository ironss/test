IP9258 unreliable
#################

Engineer claimed that the IP9258 power switch was 'unreliable'.

It would sometimes not change state when expected.


Investigation
=============

Wrote a script that changes the state of all four switches every second.

The script would occasionally hang -- every 50, 100 -- 200 cycles.

* sometimes with the old state of the switch, so the IP9258 had not
  processed the command

* sometimes with the new state of the switch, so the IP9258 had
  finished processing the command
  
Ran wireshark to see what was going on.

Found that TCP acks were getting lost, or duplicates were being
received -- this is the nature of ethernet comms, although it 
seemed to be a bit often, given that the only devices on the 
network were the PC and the IP9258 -- directly connected.

wget (the executable used to send the command to the switch)
was not recovering from the lost or duplicate ACK.

Also noticed that wget was taking two goes to get the command
across -- the first one without credentials, so it failed
authentication. It then send a second request with the
credentails; this one succeeded.

Also noticed that the IP9258 sends a UDP broadcast to port 15000 every
time a switch state changes. This is apparently the hydap protocol
(Hypack Data Acquisition Protocol). Can't see a way to turn it off.

Changed to use curl rather than wget (actually want to use libcurl
directly from Lua, but that can come later).

* curl supports disabling TCP keepalives (wget only allows disabling 
  of HTTP keepalives)
  
* curl sends credentials with first request



Results
=======

* No hangs after 1000 cycles

* Only one http request per state change, as it sends the credential
  as expected. It might have been my old version of wget.
  
  
Questions
=========

How was Neil sending commands to the IP9258?


Further work
============

Recover 12.16.163.108 -- it never recovered after resetting to factory
defaults.
